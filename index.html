            <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-orientedscripting language. JavaScript is extremly popular for a variety
            of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a 
            bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment(a web browseror Node server), it can 
            be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic contol over them.

            <ul class="contentlist">
                <li class="ctitle">Variable Declaration</li>
                <p class="ccont">JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with
                    coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All Javascript variables must be identified
                    with unique names. These unique names are called identifers.</p>
                <li class="ctitle">Variable Assignment</li>
                <p class="ccont">Assignment operators assign vaules to JavaScript variables-our cup can now have coffee poured
                    in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a vaule to a variable.</p> 
                <li class="ctitle">Data Types</li>
                <p class="ccont">Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know
                    the data types. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Booleans, Null, Number, String,
                    Array, and Object.</p>
                <li class="ctitle">Conditionals</li>
                <p class="ccont">When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisons - hitting
                    different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use condtional statements 
                    in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: IF, Else IF, Else.</p>
                <li class='ctitle'>Loops</li>
                <p class="ccont">There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all 
                    essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine if you have to 
                    run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then stop. That is a loop.</p>
                <li class="ctitle">Function</li>
                <p class="ccont">Functions are an encapsulation of a code block. When we call our function this will run 
                    that code block. Think of it as a list of intructions.</p>
